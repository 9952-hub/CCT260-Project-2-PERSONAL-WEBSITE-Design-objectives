CCT260, Project 2 PERSONAL WEBSITE Design objectives
An integrated public and professional digital presence is more than an online resume or online list of projects. There are many critical parts to a personal/professional online identify, some of which are: a custom website; domain identity; cloud-based professional portfolios; integrated social media presence; collection of rich media; aggregates of social collateral and community interactions; and last but not least a comprehensive analytics program for user insights and measuring success. These are all integral to a strong digital strategy and a broader digital presence online. In this project you will design and develop a simple website as a first and foundational step towards an online digital presence. Your website represents your professional online presence and will include critical components including a carefully written biographic statement, a professional representative photo of yourself, rich media content produced by you; a link to one of your social media websites appropriate for a professional presence, inner pages in addition to your homepage which include a selection of representative work that you feel strongly about and a process page.

      One inner page that shows highlights of your work   (e.g. photographic gallery, videos, essays, activities of interest)
      One resume page with appropriate tables for tabular information
      One rich contact information page with an integrated form. and some rich media content such as an embedded map
      One process page (e.g. representing the phases of design and development of your site such as planning, rationale, inspirations, IA, wireframes,  graphic design prototype, etc.), which includes a statement and summary of measures taken to ensure WCAG2.0 Accessibility. Coding and programming: Use HTML/CSS to develop a finalized standalone website which works on a recent  version of Firefox, Chrome and Safari on a desktop computer for a standard 1280px screen-size (mobile responsive not required).
